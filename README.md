<h3>Created using React, Electron and Node.js</h3>

**AE Explorer** is a powerful file management and efficiency tool created to speed up the Adobe After Effects workflow. Easily create, search and manage large amounts of After Effects Projects in one location quicker than it would be to create a project file repository in the windows system.

You're able to create new projects directly within the AE Explorer program so the workflow for managing an After Effects Project
starts and ends in this program rather than using Adobes native file manager which only allows access to 9 recent projects, AE Explorer allows management of hundreds in a clean, concise format which emphasises visbility.
